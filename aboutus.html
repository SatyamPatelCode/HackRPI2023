        <h1>About our Project</h1>
        As students at RPI, we have found it confusing and at times frustrating to try and keep track of the office hours for each of our classes. 
        Our goal is to make this process easier for students by creating a website that centralizes the office hours times and locations for every class at RPI.

        <h1>Meet the Team</h1>
