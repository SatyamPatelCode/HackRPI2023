# HackRPI2023
As students at RPI, we have found it confusing and at times frustrating to try and keep track of the office hours for each of our classes. Our goal is to make this process easier for students by creating a website that centralizes the office hours times and locations for every class at RPI. We currently have implemented the front-end functionality of the project, but still need to work on the back-end.
